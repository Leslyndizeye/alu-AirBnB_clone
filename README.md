# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Description

This project aims to create a console-based clone of the AirBnB project. The focus is on developing a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects efficiently.

### Features

- **BaseModel Class**: A parent class responsible for initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.
- **Serialization/Deserialization Flow**: Establishes a simple flow between instances, dictionaries, JSON strings, and files.
- **AirBnB Classes**: Implement classes for various AirBnB objects such as User, State, City, Place, etc., all inheriting from the BaseModel class.
- **File Storage Engine**: Develop the first abstracted storage engine for the project, known as File Storage.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.

### Command Interpreter Capabilities

The command interpreter provides the following functionalities:

- **Create**: Generate new objects such as User or Place instances.
- **Retrieve**: Retrieve objects from files, databases, etc.
- **Operations**: Perform operations on objects, including counting, computing stats, etc.
- **Update**: Modify attributes of existing objects.
- **Destroy**: Delete objects from the system.
